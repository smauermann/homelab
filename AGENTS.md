# Project rules

- keep it simple, simple is better than complex and more robust
- if you don't know what chart values there are, use `helm show values repo/chartname --version 1.2.3`
- use semantic commits
- after every logical block of work, commit your changes
- never kubectl delete anything unless I approved it
- do not commit straight to main, each feature or fix must be committed to an appropriately named branch
